# MakeDownloadfoldersPrettyAgain
This small Python project makes your download-folder finally pretty again. <br />
It sorts all files by their extensions into according subfolders. <br />
Once setup, it runs in the background and perdiodically sorts. Of course, autostart can also be opted, if desired. <br />
# Example: 
![example_img](/readme/MakeDownloadfolderPrettyAgain_example.png) <br />
# Setup:
![setup_img](/readme/MakeDownloadfolderPrettyAgain.png) <br />
1. Choose your Downloadfolder / Destinationfolder via the file dialog
2. Extensions and categories can be added in the settings.ini file.  <br /> Extensions might be appended by separating them with commas.  <br /> Categories must be appended at the end of the file.
3. Choose the interval in seconds. Choose, whether the program should be stared with Windows.
 <br />
 
# Run in background
